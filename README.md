# dotfiles
My dotfiles. Most notably, configuration for:
- i3
- polybar
- rofi
- dunst
- gtk themeing via adw-gtk3 and gradience
- qt themeing via kvantum with qt5ct and qt6ct
- zsh with powerlevel10k

also, a bunch of tweaks to move various things out of my home directory and into .config

Still to come
- More rearranging things out of my home folder
- if I was really cool I'd write a themeing script to update the various things all in one place rather than doing it ad-hoc with autostart things
